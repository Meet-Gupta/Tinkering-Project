## Overview

This application implements an RFID-based home security system with multi-factor authentication. It incorporates RFID access control with an additional fingerprint sensor and a mobile app interface for enhanced security.

## Features
- RFID-based authentication for physical access.
- Multi-factor authentication with fingerprint sensors.
- Temporary passkey generation.
- Entry logs for authorized and unauthorized access attempts.
- Firebase backend integration for storing user and access data.
- Simple and intuitive mobile app interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Dart (Flutter Framework)
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore
- **Cloud Services:** Firebase Authentication and Firestore
- **Mobile Framework:** Flutter
- **Others:** SharedPreferences for local storage

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Install Flutter SDK ([Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)).
- Set up a Firebase project and configure the application with `google-services.json`.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd rfid-home-security
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
4. Run the application on an emulator or a physical device:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

### Generating Temporary Passkeys
- Access the "Generate Temp Passkey" feature on the home screen.
- Enter a 4-digit passcode, which will be saved to the database and used for temporary access.

### Viewing Logs
- Navigate to "View Logs" to see entry records. Logs include details of authorized and unauthorized access attempts with timestamps.

### Login and Signup
- New users can register via the signup screen, while existing users can log in using their credentials.

## API and Database Usage

### Firebase Firestore
- **User Data Collection**:
  - Stores user details such as email, password hash, and unique identifiers.
- **Access Logs Collection**:
  - Logs each access attempt with fields:
    - `succAuth`: Boolean indicating success or failure.
    - `timestamp`: Timestamp of the access attempt.

### SharedPreferences
- Stores session-related data locally for user authentication and app state management.
